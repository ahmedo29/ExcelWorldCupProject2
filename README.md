# World Cup Project

## Description
This project involves extracting, profiling, and analysing the Top 50 Goalscorers in the World Cup data. The focus of this project was to create a dashboard which includes key information, such as the top 10 goalscorers in World Cup history, average goals per team out of the top 50 goalscorers, average goals per team, and several other insights. This projects aims to provide insightful visualisations for better undertsanding and interpretation of the data.

## Installation
Cleaned Data, Analysed Data, and the Dashboard:
	World Cup Dashboard

All of the cleaned and analysed data is in this Excel file.

## Process
Data Importation: I downloaded all of the raw data from Kaggle, and then imported it all into Microsoft Excel

Data Cleaning: I then formatted all the data into tables, making sure all the columns are in the correct formats, that there is no missing data, there is no duplicated data which is not needed, and corrected any errors and inconsistencies within the data. 

Data Analysis: I analysed the data to create useful insights, such as the top 10 goalscorers in World Cup history, average goals per team out of the top 50 goalscorers, average goals per team, and several other insights. I did this by using a range of data analysis skills, such as VLookups, Excel Functions, and Pivot Tables. 

Data Visualisations: I used the pivot tables to then create insightful visualiations to show a range of insights in the dashboard I created
